Now my name is Buddy, don't you pity me
Don't you pity me, don't you pity me
My name is Buddy, don't you pity me
Don't you pity me, don't you pity me
Just because I ain't so big, you think I'm small
Well, you think I'm small, now you think I'm small
You go around with your head up in the clouds
You just tall, that's all, you just tall, that's all

Now, if you like your tree, better watch out for your tree
Watch out for your tree, Lord, that tree ain't free
The birds won't be round just to keep you company, no
Keep you company, no keep you company

Now if you like your little backyard, watch out for your backyard
Don't let them put a toll road right through your backyard
If you like your little backyard, watch out for your backyard
Don't let them put a toll road right through your backyard

Now You go around with your head up in the clouds
Head up in the clouds, your head up in the clouds
You go around with your head up in the clouds
Your head up in the clouds, oh your head up in the clouds
You ain't so big, now, you just tall, that's all

Now this land was made for you and me
Better watch out for your land, better watch out for your land
This land was made just for you and me
Better watch out for your land, better watch out for your land
