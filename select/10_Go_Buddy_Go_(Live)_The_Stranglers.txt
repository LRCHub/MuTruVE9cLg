Boogie woogie

The boys and the girls are all dancing around
Dancing all night to the crazy sound
It's the newest thing to hit this land
The boys and the girls are all holding hands

I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go

I'm with my friend Bob having a good time
I've got me some speed and I'm doing fine
But Bob is not dancing no sir-ee
He's got a likely eye on a little lady

I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go
What I say?
I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go

Yeah boogie now Dave...

Elbow rooming his way around the floor (oh)
You can see him he's sitting by the door (oh)
All the chickies they wanna see him dance some more
(ONE TWO THREE FOUR)

Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go

I see we're changing partners, but that's not for me
I notice Bob isn't joining the party
He's standing on the outside, looking in
Wishing that little chickie was with him

I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go

The party is over and we're all going home
I can't find Bob so I'm leaving alone
But wait a minute, who is that, I can see?
None other than Bob with that girl on his knee

I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go
Tell me now
I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go
Boogie

Yeah
I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go
What I said?
I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go
One more time
I said
Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy Go Buddy, Go Go Go
