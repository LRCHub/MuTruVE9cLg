I went to see, to see what I could see
I couldn't find no one, but everyone found me
It ain't no good to fool around all day
So listen everybody, 'cos here is what we say

What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy
What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy

What's the time, as you walk? I don't know
As you fly? I don't know
As you climb? I don't know
It better get better, it better get better

I'm not shy and, will someone lend a hand?
Don't sit around all day, don't want to join a band
It ain't no good to fool around all day
So listen everybody, 'cos here is what we say

What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy
What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy

What's the time, as you walk? I don't know
As you fly? I don't know
As you climb? I don't know
It better get better, it better get better

I'm in here and I really don't care
I'm much too busy grooving, oh
It ain't no good to fool around all day
So listen everybody, 'cos here is what we say

What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy
What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy

What's the time, as you walk? I don't know
As you fly? I don't know
As you climb? I don't know
It better get better, it better get better

What's the time? Hey, buddy
What's the time? Hey, buddy

What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy
What's the time? Hey, buddy
Hey, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy

As you walk? I don't know
As you fly? I don't know
As you climb? I don't know
It better get better, it better get better
