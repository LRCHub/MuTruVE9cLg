Hello Buddy I can see how you've been
You've had all the luck that passed me by.
Hello Buddy won't you bring me on in
Cut me off a piece of your pie.

Hello Buddy it's a shame and a sin
Making all that money on your own.
Hello Buddy don't you know your old friend
Standing on the doorsteps all alone.

Hello buddy
Just let me try
To tell you why
Why?
Hello Buddy
I didn't think
You'd turn a blind eye.

Hello Buddy well my woman has gone
Left me
Gone away without a word.
Hello Buddy don't you think it was wrong
Tell me it's the worst thing that you've heard.

Hello Buddy
Just...

Hello buddy I can see how you've been
You've had all the luck that passed me by.
Hello Buddy won't you bring me on in
Cut me off a piece of your pie.

Hello Buddy.
Hello Buddy.
