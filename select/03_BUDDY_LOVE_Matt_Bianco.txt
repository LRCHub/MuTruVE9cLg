Turning up the stereo getting ready for the night
Got a jd on the go, coz it makes me feel alright
I don't wanna think about the bills I'm paying
I don't care what your politics are saying
I don't wanna analyze your problems baby
All I want is just to have some fun tonight

Got your love on my agenda
You couldn't ask for more
Make it a night to remember
What are we waiting for

I got the moves
I got the money
I got the suit can't get enough
I wanna dance
I wanna honey
Tonight I feel like buddy love

Driving through the neon lights heading for the purple pit
Got the ladies in my sights did you see those curvy hips?
I don't wanna think about the bills I'm paying
I don't care what your politics are saying
I don't wanna analyze your problems baby
All I want is just to have some fun tonight

Got your love on my agenda
You couldn't ask for more
Make it a night to remember
What are we waiting for

I got the moves
I got the money
I got the suit can't get enough
I wanna dance
I wanna honey
Tonight I feel like buddy love
